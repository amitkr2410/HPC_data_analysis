### To run JETSCAPE software package in WayneState high-performance computing facilities, follow the command outlined below:

### (1) Edit the directory structure and provide proper path of data folders, input XML file and output DIR:
        Open and edit "run_jetscape.py"
        Change the directory address "/wsu/tmp/AmitAAPaper/HPC_data_analysis/WayneStateHPC" to your location.
        Create all sub-directories "RawFile","FinalData",  except "JETSCAPE". "JETSCAPEPE" dir will be created in step-3
        "JETSCAPEDIR" is location of JETSCAPE code that you would download in step-3
        "TestOutDIR" is location to store Test*.out ASCII files that will be generated by JETSCAPE code
        "FinalOutputDIR" is location to store "FinalStateHadrons" files 
        "CodeDIR" is location of this code "WayneStateHPC" that contains "run_jetscape.py".
        "Exec" does not need modification
        "UserXML" is location of your xml file "jetscape_user_pbpb_grid.xml" that that contains proper settings     
### (2) Set appropriate flags in the reference input XML file:
        Open and edit "jetscape_user_pbpb_grid.xml"

### (3) Download JETSCAPE code package from git-hub and compile the software:
        git clone -b main https://github.com/JETSCAPE/JETSCAPE.git
        cd JETSCAPE
        mkdir build
        cd external_packages
        ./get_music.sh	
        ./get_iSS.sh
        ./get_lbtTab.sh
        cd ../build
        cmake ..
        make -j4

### (4) Outer for loop "i" is for pthat-bins
        Set "NumberOfpTHatBins" 
        Set Number of subruns for each pthat-bins

### (5) Go to funtion "def ptHardBins(i)" and write all pthatBins you want to run
        Make sure it matches with "NumberOfpTHatBins" set in step-4 
        
### (6) To Launch the job, edit file "run_jetscape.py" and set directory and run the command below:
        python run_jetscape.py
    
       check "RawFile" directory for various output files
